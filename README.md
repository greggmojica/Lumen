# Lumen
An iOS app for demonstrating binary code; Lumen illuminates the specific light bulbs using the Hue API. Based off Harvard's binary bulbs CS50 app, open sourced as Harvard does not freely provide their own projects. May be used as a class project for educators following the CS50 or CS50 AP cirriculum.

Hue bulbs are not required, but add to the level of interactivity. Users can still play the binary "game" and "practice" modes on their iPads, "visualize" mode requires the Hue bulbs. 

Optimized for iOS 9 and Swift 2; features Split Screen Mode.
