# Lumen
App for demonstrating binary code using light bulbs by illuminating the respective bulbs. Uses the Hue API. Based off Harvard's cs50 app, open sourced as Harvard does not freely provide their own projects. May be used as a class project for educators following the CS50 or CS50 AP cirriculum.

Hue bulbs are not required, but add to the level of interactivity. Users can still play the binary "game" and "practice" modes, visualize requires the bulbs.
